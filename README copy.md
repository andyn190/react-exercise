# React developer take-home exercise

## Instructions

### Overview

- This iteration of the hiring app isn't full fleshed out and the solution is open ended
- The app is contained within `apps/hiring-app-01`
- to run the app run `pnpm start` (note we use pnpm, repo not tested with npm/yarn)

### Tools we use

- Since there is no app shell, you are free to use any libraries/tools/anything you want except the addition of a framework (next/remix)
- The most important libraries we use are:
  - Mantine (UI components)
  - React Hook Library
  - React Router 5
  - React Table
- Using these libraries would be appreciated, but is not required
- Mantine is installed already

### Requirements:

- There is a promise based Mock api in `apps/hiring-app-01/src/api.ts`
- Create a todo app that utilizes this mock api
- The app can be as fully featured as you would like
- While expansive functionality is a bonus, overall architecture, code quality, 
robustness, error handling are the primary qualities judged for
- You can spend as long or as little time as you feel is necessary to do a good job, however please let us know how long you spent.
Don't include time spent researching/reading docs.
- While there are no strict requirements for the app, multiple routed views would be appreciated

### Other Considerations

- If you find something you think is an error with the app, feel free to fix it and note it for our awareness
